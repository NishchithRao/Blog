Open source is hard. Maintaining a well known repository, closing issues, addressing comments regularly etc is not an easy thing to do. People often consider it as an easy shortcut for jobs. This time, it even overboard.

## Some Context

3 weeks ago [Theo](Theo) made a video saying `Dont contribute to open source`, stating that you shouldn't open source because you want a job, or some other reward.
He's right. Open source is not for getting something, you might work on a repo for years and people might not even know who you are and thats completely okay. Theo went on to correctly mention that this happens mostly because of people running for recognition with
events like Hacktoberfest and social media in general. The video states several reddit examples and articles so you should definitely check it out.

<br />
The Software Industry is a place where you can learn the skills from anywhere. ApnaCollege is a YouTube channel that teaches all things you need to get a Software Developer job.
About 5 months ago, they released a video explaining git concepts and how can people get started on it. The video is an hour long but it gets interesting in the last 3 minutes. The presenter explains how can you fork a popular github repository, make some changes and and raise a 
Pull Request to the original repository, which will make you an 'Open Source contributor'. The presenter goes to the ExpressJS repository, creates a fork into their account, updates the readme and raises a Pull request.
The video also says that how important it is for one to do open source contributions because it helps them get jobs, people conducting interviews always search for open source contributors and one gets referals.

## The problem begins

New people into any field often like to follow other people. They don't like to think. Instead people just blindly follow whatever popular people say. It gets worse as these people almost always mis-interpret whatever insttructions they try to follow
and end up doing bad things. The Apna College video gave an example of contributing an open source and all these want to be in tech people went mad. Everyone started to raise PRs to the ExpressJS
repository with changes on thre README file, adding their names or `Apna College` etc. The Open issues board started to get spammed indefinitely.

## The Effect

People started to see the ExpressJS repository getting spammed and got mad. The Primeagen made a video ranted about it a little bit on Twitch and posted it as a video on YouTube. Popular Indian tech Youtubers like Harkirat Singh added a video on Dos and Don'ts of
open source contributions. YouTuber and Teacher, Hitesh Choudhary, sarcastically created a repo called `ReadMe Contributions` and asked people to contribute to this repo instead of the real ones so that people could `show` 
themseleves as open source contributers. Tech Twitter started adding posts on how open source is going downhill due these kinds of mis directions and misuse of events like the Hacktober fests.

## Conclusion

Its been known that the Job market is crazy right now, and therefore people are desperate to get a job, through any means possible. Open source is viewed as a way to build connections and get hired. Its not. Thats a different thing and its called an event or a Meetup. Open source is a 
charity done by people who took time out of their jobs, saw a problem popping up at multiple places and decided to solve it for everyone. Open Source contribution is a way to make that solution better with each issue. If you want to contribute, try to find actual issues, shadow the repo first, solve it and politely ask if your
solution to the problem is a viable one. Another way could be bringing your own package or a piece of software that solves a problem for everyone and those people will contribute to your repo.
Open source might get you a job but that should not be the reason to contribute.
